# 👋 Hi, I’m Firdaus
🎯 **Measurement Engineer | Oil & Gas | LNG | Tech Explorer**  
With over 15 years in the energy industry, I specialize in metering systems, calibrations, and data — making sure the numbers are right, even when the weather isn’t.

## 🧭 About This Site
This is my **digital workspace** — part knowledge vault, part curiosity playground — where I share:

- 🛠️ Technical notes on flow measurement, audits, and instrumentation  
- ✍️ Personal reflections and lessons learned  
- 🌱 Wellness ideas and practical habits  
- 📊 Side explorations in technical analysis and scripting

#### 🗓️ Dusting Off the Cobwebs
This GitHub has been around since 2013 — mostly chilling in the background.  
But 2025 is my reboot year. I'm aiming to post at least once a week, turning this space into an evolving notebook of things I’m learning, building, or just nerding out about.

So if you stumble across an unfinished note or a half-baked idea — that’s just part of the process. 🙂

## 🎒 What I Enjoy
- 📚 Turning technical complexity into human-readable notes  
- 🤖 Tinkering with data tools and ChatGPT prompts  
- 📈 Building scripts and tools for financial data analysis  
- 🚧 Learning in public (even when the notes aren’t perfect)
